PortraitBuilder
===============

Contains the source code for the UI project, and a cut down version of the
CK2Utils library.

The Parser grammar for the Portraits has been included, but it was last used
on an older version of Hime and may need some changes.


DLC use has been partially implemented.

==========

The DevIL library, with the DevIL.Net wrapper. It, and the .Net wrapper can
be found at http://openil.sourceforge.net/
