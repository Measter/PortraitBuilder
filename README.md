PortraitBuilder
===============

Contains the source code for the UI project, and a cut down version of the
CK2Utils library.

The Parser grammar for the Portraits has been included, but it was last used
on an older version of Hime and may need some changes.

DLC use has been partially implemented.

Note: this project will no longer be updated, and pull requests will be ignored.
Please fork to continue development.
